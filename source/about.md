#### Fate/Zero (Japanese: フェイト/ゼロ) is a novel written by Gen Kubuchi. At first, there was only the first volume, "The Secret Tales of the Fourth Holy Grail War", which was later turned into a library and adapted into an anime. Qualitatively tells the story of a parallel world with the same beginning and ending as the Fourth Holy Grail War in the orthodox timeline.
